1. Save your trained model and label encoders.

2. Test the API. Use Postman or cURL to send POST requests.

Example with Postman:
-> URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
-> Method: POST
-> Body (JSON):
{
    "gender": "Male",
    "age": 45,
    "hypertension": 1,
    "heart_disease": 0,
    "ever_married": "Yes",
    "work_type": "Private",
    "Residence_type": "Urban",
    "avg_glucose_level": 120.5,
    "bmi": 28.0,
    "smoking_status": "formerly smoked"
}

3. Run the Flask Server. Save the script (e.g., app.py) and run it: python app.py.

4. For production, consider deploying with Gunicorn and hosting on AWS, Heroku, or similar platforms.
